# Budget App

This repo will be a simple budget app for me. If you would like to use it, be my guest. 

## TODO
1. get front end look down.
2. add forms for front end.
3. add backend rest for transactions and items


We need a bitem.
This bitem will have a name and a budget and a category. 

Need a budget that you can create each month. It should be able to safe your bitems.

					'category'=>'Food',
					'category'=>'Giving',
					'category'=>'Savings',
					'category'=>'Housing',
					'category'=>'Transportation',
					'category'=>'Lifestyle',
					'category'=>'Health',
					'category'=>'Insurance',
The previous are categories I will need to add the ability to make items for.
